# WorldHappiness-dashboard
This project is a dashboard created using the Plotly with Dash software, that visualizes data from the World Happiness Report dataset. The objective of this dashboard is to transform data into meaningful and interactive visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the World Happiness Report, which contains data about the happiness levels of people from different countries around the world. The dataset includes various factors that contribute to happiness, such as economic status, social support, health, and freedom.

## Visualization

The dashboard provides a variety of interactive visualizations, including:

- A world map that displays the happiness scores of different countries, allowing users to hover over each country to see additional details.
- A bar chart that shows the top 10 happiest countries, with the option to filter by year.
- A scatter plot that displays the relationship between two variables, such as happiness score and GDP per capita.
- A histogram that shows the distribution of a single variable, such as happiness scores.

## Validation
Validation has been taken into consideration throughout the development of this dashboard. The data has been carefully cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy, and the interactive features have been thoroughly tested to ensure that they function as expected.

In addition to testing and quality assurance, user feedback has also been collected to validate the effectiveness of the dashboard. Surveys have been used to collect feedback from users on their experience with the dashboard, including what they found useful and what could be improved. The feedback collected from surveys has been used to make improvements to the dashboard to ensure that it meets the needs of users and provides a valuable tool for exploring and understanding the data.
